# udacity data analysis nanodegree

Materials in this repository are assignments from the Udacity Data Analysis course I took in October 2017 - January 2018. The course had three sections: data visualization in R, programmatic data cleaning and visualization in Python, and data storytelling in Tableau. Tableau visualizations are available on <a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/hannah3406#!/">my Tableau public site.</a>
