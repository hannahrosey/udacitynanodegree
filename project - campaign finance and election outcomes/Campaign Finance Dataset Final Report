## Introduction

In this project for the Udacity data analysis nanodegree, I'm going to explore 
the influence of campaign contributions on 2014 congressional election outcomes. 

Both the campaign contribution and election outcome datasets are from 
the federal elections commission. To prepare the datasets, I downloaded the FEC
data and cleaned it using Python. Cleaning steps included fixing duplicate 
observations (such as candidates who ran for the same office with different 
party endorsements), changing datatypes, and limiting both datasets to candidates
in the 2014 midterms.

In the campaign finance dataset, `camapign_finance_clean_data.csv`, each row is
a campaign contribution. In the election outcomes dataset, 
`election_outcomes_clean_data.csv`, each row is a candidate. I merge them using
the FEC ID, which includes the state, district, and a unique identifier. As 
I discuss in the course of analysis, there are issues with missing data in this
merged dataframe; for much of my analysis, I use only the campaign finance dataset
as a workaround.

## Read In, Data Preparation, and Univariate Analysis
```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
finance <- read.csv('campaign_finance_clean_data.csv')
finance <- finance[!names(finance) %in% 'X']
str(finance)
finance$TRANSACTION_DATE <- as.Date(finance$TRANSACTION_DATE,format='%Y-%m-%d')
finance$CAND_CHAMBER <- substr(finance$CAND_ID,1,1)

outcomes <- read.csv('election_outcomes_clean_data.csv')
outcomes <- outcomes[!names(outcomes) %in% 'X']
str(outcomes)

overlap <- intersect(finance$CAND_ID,outcomes$CAND_ID)
```

The two datasets overlap for ```r length(overlap)``` candidates.

```{r,echo=TRUE}

    # clean finance and outcome data available for 265 candidates from 2014 
    # midterm elections

finance_agg <- 
  finance %>% 
  group_by(CAND_ID,CAND_NAME,CAND_PARTY,CAND_STATE,CAND_DISTRICT,CAND_RACE_STATUS,
           CAND_CHAMBER) %>% 
  summarise(TOTAL_CONTRIBUTIONS = sum(TRANSACTION_AMOUNT),
            MEAN_CONTRIBUTION_AMOUNT = mean(TRANSACTION_AMOUNT),
            FIRST_CONTRIBUTION = min(TRANSACTION_DATE),
            NUMBER_OF_CONTRIBUTIONS = n())

df = inner_join(finance_agg,outcomes,by=as.character('CAND_ID'))
df$STATE_DISTRICT <- paste(df$CAND_STATE,'-',df$CAND_DISTRICT,sep='')

tail(df)
```

First, I'll do some histograms of my variables.

```{r,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}

summary(df$CAND_PARTY)
summary(df$CAND_PARTY)
summary(df$CAND_RACE_STATUS)
table(df$CAND_CHAMBER)
summary(df$TOTAL_CONTRIBUTIONS)

tot_contributions <- ggplot(data=finance_agg,aes(x=TOTAL_CONTRIBUTIONS)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth=.2) +
  theme_classic() +
  scale_x_log10()

tot_contributions

```

Total contributions seem to be relatively normally distributed around $100,000,
with a spike around $10,000, too. This is surprising--I know most campaigns spend
in the millions. This suggests that this data is incomplete, or only a subset of
contributions--something to keep in mind.

```{r,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}

summary(finance_agg$MEAN_CONTRIBUTION_AMOUNT)

mean_contributions <- ggplot(data=finance_agg,aes(x=MEAN_CONTRIBUTION_AMOUNT)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  theme_classic() +
  scale_x_log10()

mean_contributions

```

Again, mean contributions seem to be relatively normally distributed around
\$1,000, with a far outlier above \$100,000.

```{r,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}

summary(finance_agg$FIRST_CONTRIBUTION)

first_contribution <- ggplot(data=finance_agg,aes(x=FIRST_CONTRIBUTION)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  theme_classic()

first_contribution

```

The date of first contribution is bimodally distributed, with a peak early in
2013 and a second peak right before the election. More contributions 
occur in the year leading up to the election than the year of the election 
itself, which is somewhat surprising.

```{r,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
summary(finance_agg$NUMBER_OF_CONTRIBUTIONS)

n_contributions <- ggplot(data=finance_agg,aes(x=NUMBER_OF_CONTRIBUTIONS)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  theme_classic() +
  scale_x_log10()

n_contributions
```

Number of contributions is normally distributed around \$1,000, with a big spike
at 1 contribution.

### Bivariate Analysis: Wins and Losses by Party
```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
party_hist <- ggplot(data=df,aes(x=VOTESHARE,fill=CAND_PARTY)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth=5) + 
  scale_fill_brewer(type='qual',palette='Dark2',direction=-1) +
  geom_vline(xintercept=50,size=.2) +
  theme_classic() +
  xlab('Voteshare') +
  ylab('# Candidates')

party_hist
```

Let's break this out by candidate status: challenger (C), incumbent (I), 
or open race (O)

```{r,echo=FALSE}
candidate_status <- ggplot(data=df,aes(x=VOTESHARE,fill=CAND_PARTY)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth=3) + 
  scale_fill_brewer(type='qual',palette='Spectral',direction=-1) +
  geom_vline(xintercept=50,size=.2) +
  theme_classic() +
  xlab('Voteshare (%)') +
  ylab('Candidates (#)') + 
  facet_wrap(~CAND_RACE_STATUS) 

candidate_status
```

Let's also break things out by state in cases where a state has a significant 
number of races, e.g. 10 or more.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
many_race_states = subset(
  as.data.frame(sort(table(df$CAND_STATE),decreasing=TRUE)),
  Freq>10)

candidate_state <- 
  ggplot(data=subset(df,df$CAND_STATE %in% many_race_states$Var1),
         aes(x=VOTESHARE,fill=CAND_PARTY)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth=1) + 
  scale_fill_brewer(type='qual',palette='Spectral',direction=-1) +
  theme_classic() +
  geom_vline(xintercept=50) +
  facet_wrap(~CAND_STATE)  +
  xlab('Voteshare (%)') +
  ylab('Candidates (#)')

candidate_state
```

From this initial visualization, I notice that the dataset I created by merging
finance and election outcomes data is a little unbalanced.

The dataset includes slightly more data on winning candidates (>50% of voteshare) 
than on losing candidates (<50% of voteshare). This is likely due to the fact that 
campaign contribution data was incomplete. Candidates in the outcomes dataset with 
very small (<1%) voteshare were also frequently bundled into the category "Scattered." 
This biases both datasets somewhat towards winning candidates; we can also see
this impact in a boxplot, or when we table our data by chamber and win/loss:

```{r,echo=TRUE}
#Table of Chamber (House or Senate) vs. Electoral Outcome (0 = loss, 1 = win)
table(df$CAND_CHAMBER,df$WIN_LOSS)

```

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
candidate_status_box <- ggplot(data=df,aes(y=VOTESHARE,x=CAND_RACE_STATUS)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_classic() +
  ylab('Voteshare (%)') +
  xlab('Race Type') +
  geom_hline(yintercept=50,size=.2)

candidate_status_box

```

The limitation of missing candidates means that this dataset may not be ideal
for causal questions--i.e., predicting what causes a candidate to win or lose.
The approximately normal distribution we see in the above histogram is most likely
due to the data we've chosen. If we had data on more candidates per race, we would 
likely see much more skewed data, with most candidates falling below 50% voteshare.

Even given this limitation, I notice that incumbency seems to play a big role
in outcomes. I can examine this trend further by coloring the histogram by 
win/loss instead of party, since in a race with more than 2 candidates, a 
voteshare of less than 50% may be sufficient to win:

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

candidate_status_wl <- ggplot(data=df,aes(x=VOTESHARE,fill=as.factor(WIN_LOSS))) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth=1) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept=50,size=.2) +
  theme_classic() +
  xlab('Voteshare (%)') +
  ylab('Candidates (#)') + 
  facet_wrap(~CAND_RACE_STATUS)

candidate_status_wl
```

As this histogram shows, winning candidates were almost all incumbents
and losing candidates were almost all challengers. Given the strength of this
covariance in this dataset, it may actually be more interesting to examine 
differences between incumbents and challengers rather than winners and losers.
The contribution dataset can shed light on the material differences between these
types of candidates.

This prompts some questions, which we can answer using the aggreggated
finance dataset.
  
## Bivariate Analysis: Incumbents vs. Challengers

### Contribution Patterns

#### Do incumbents raise more money?

A first intuition about the differences between incumbents and challengers is 
that incumbents may raise more money overall than challengers. We can start 
by looking at patterns in the sum of all contributions in the campaign finance
dataset:

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

contribution_hist <- ggplot(data=finance_agg,aes(x=TOTAL_CONTRIBUTIONS,fill=CAND_RACE_STATUS)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth=.25) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette='Dark2') +
  theme_classic() +
  ylab('Candidates (#)') +
  xlab('Log of Total Contributions ($)') +
  scale_x_log10()

contribution_box <- ggplot(data=finance_agg,aes(x=CAND_RACE_STATUS,y=TOTAL_CONTRIBUTIONS)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_classic() +
  xlab('Race Type') +
  ylab('Log of Total Contributions ($)') +
  scale_y_log10()

grid.arrange(contribution_hist,contribution_box,nrow=2)

```

These plots support the hypothesis that incumbents receive more contributions
overall by several orders of magnitude: the median aggregate contributions to
challenger candidates is around $1,000 (with a big spread) compared to a median 
of $100,000 for incumbent candidates.

This leads to a question of why incumbents raise more: do they get more 
contributions, bigger contributions, or both?

### Do incumbents receive larger contributions?

We can check out the size of the **mean** contribution candidates received:

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

contribution_mean_hist <- ggplot(data=finance_agg,aes(x=MEAN_CONTRIBUTION_AMOUNT,fill=CAND_RACE_STATUS)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth=.075) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette='Dark2') +
  theme_classic() +
  ylab('Candidates (#)') +
  xlab('Log of Mean Contributions ($)') +
  scale_x_log10(breaks=c(seq(0,2000,2000),seq(20000,150000,100000)),limits=c(300,150000))

contribution_mean_box <- ggplot(data=finance_agg,aes(x=CAND_RACE_STATUS,y=MEAN_CONTRIBUTION_AMOUNT)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_classic() +
  xlab('Race Type') +
  ylab('Log of Mean Contributions ($)') +
  scale_y_log10()

grid.arrange(contribution_mean_box,contribution_mean_hist,nrow=2)

```

These plots show us that the type of race a candidate runs doesn't seem to 
determine how big their average campaign contribution is. This may have to do
with the underlying data: while cleaning the campaign finance dataset, I 
observed that entities frequently 'batched' many small contributions (e.g., 40
contributions of 500 dollars each instead of giving 20k). 

By going back to the original finance dataset and aggregating by committee as 
well as candidate, we can get rid of this "batched" effect and see what a 
committee's mean overall contribution was to incumbents vs. challengers.

Looking at the underlying finance data confirms that the average size of the
contribution from a single PAC to a candidate does not vary based on incumbency.

```{r, echo=TRUE}

finance_by_committee <- finance %>% 
  group_by(CAND_ID,CAND_RACE_STATUS,COMMITTEE_ID) %>% 
  summarise('COMMITTEE_TOTAL_CONTRIBUTIONS'=sum(TRANSACTION_AMOUNT))

head(finance_by_committee)

  # each row in this dataframe represents the total amount a given political
  # action committee (PAC) gave to a given candidate in the 2014 election.
  
committee_histogram <- 
  ggplot(data=finance_by_committee,aes(x=COMMITTEE_TOTAL_CONTRIBUTIONS,fill=CAND_RACE_STATUS)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth=.25) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette='Dark2') +
  theme_classic() +
  ylab('Candidates (#)') +
  xlab('Log of Total Contributions ($)') +
  scale_x_log10()

committee_box <- 
  ggplot(data=finance_by_committee,aes(x=CAND_RACE_STATUS,y=COMMITTEE_TOTAL_CONTRIBUTIONS)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_classic() +
  xlab('Race Type') +
  ylab('Log of Total Contributions ($)') +
  scale_y_log10()

grid.arrange(committee_histogram,committee_box,nrow=2)

```

### Do incumbents receive more contributions?

Since the number rather than the size of contributions seems to matter,
we can further quantify the difference in the **number of contributions** a 
candidate receives based on incumbancy status.

The histogram and summary of contributions by race type suggest that an incumbent
gets 5 times as many contributions as a challenger and 3-4 times as many times as
a candidate in an open race.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

n_contributions_hist <- 
  ggplot(data=finance_agg,aes(color=CAND_RACE_STATUS,x=NUMBER_OF_CONTRIBUTIONS)) +
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth=10) +
  theme_classic() +
  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(2,1000)) +
  xlab('Number of contributions') +
  ylab('Candidates (#)')

n_contributions_hist

by(finance_agg$NUMBER_OF_CONTRIBUTIONS,finance_agg$CAND_RACE_STATUS,summary)

```

#### Do incumbents receive contributions earlier in the cycle?

Another possible source of incumbent advantage may be that funders identify the
candidate earlier in the race than a challenger. If this is the case, it could
impact challenger fundraising strategies.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

first_contribution_hist <- 
  ggplot(data=subset(finance_agg,!is.na(finance_agg$FIRST_CONTRIBUTION)),
         aes(x=FIRST_CONTRIBUTION,fill=CAND_RACE_STATUS)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth=5) +
  theme_classic() +
  xlab('Date of First Contribution') +
  ylab('Candidates (#)')

first_contribution_hist

```

This plot of first contribution date sheds a really interesting light on the
disparity between incumbent and challenger fundraising. It shows that 
incumbents may get more contributions simply because they start earlier, or even 
if candidates start fundraising at the same time, an incumbents' greater name 
recognition may give them an edge in fundraising years in advance. 

It's also likely that money spent earlier in a campaign is more effective: 
reaching your voter earlier than your competitor through ads, etc. may carry a 
significant advantage. 

### Multivariate Analysis: 
### Is there a relationship between timing and size of contributions?

It's even possible that when a PAC contributes influences the size of their gift.
To test this, I will use the original campaign finance dataset--in which individual 
contributions, rather than candidates, were the unit of analysis:

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
str(finance)

contribution_size_over_time <- 
  ggplot(data=finance,
         aes(x=TRANSACTION_DATE,y=TRANSACTION_AMOUNT,color=CAND_RACE_STATUS)) +
  geom_point(position=position_jitter(),alpha=1/2) +
  scale_y_log10() +
  theme_classic() +
  xlab('Date of Contribution') +
  ylab('Contribution Amount ($)')

contribution_size_over_time

```

The plot of contribution size over time shows clear horizontal bars that suggest
common contribution 'tranches,' such as $1,000. Around July of the election year,
the number of contributions increseases (points are denser) and the spread increases:
there are more big contributions, but the biggest increase is in small contributions
(under $1,000).

### Is this pattern the same for senate and house? For Democrats vs. Republicans?

```{r,echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

conb_over_time_chamber <- 
  ggplot(data=finance,
         aes(x=TRANSACTION_DATE,y=TRANSACTION_AMOUNT,color=CAND_RACE_STATUS)) +
  geom_point(position=position_jitter(),alpha=1/2) +
  scale_y_log10() +
  theme_classic() +
  xlab('Date of Contribution') +
  ylab('Contribution Amount ($)') +
  facet_wrap(~CAND_CHAMBER)

conb_over_time_party <- 
  ggplot(data=subset(finance,finance$CAND_PARTY %in% c('REP','DEM')),
         aes(x=TRANSACTION_DATE,y=TRANSACTION_AMOUNT,color=CAND_RACE_STATUS)) +
  geom_point(position=position_jitter(),alpha=1/2) +
  scale_y_log10() +
  theme_classic() +
  xlab('Date of Contribution') +
  ylab('Contribution Amount ($)') +
  facet_wrap(~CAND_PARTY)


grid.arrange(conb_over_time_chamber,conb_over_time_party,nrow=2)

```

The trend seems quite similar between the house and the senate and Democrats
and Republicans, with the exception that many more of the 'challenger' 
contributions were to Republicans vs. Democrats. 

Did this correspond to a greater
number of Republican challenger candidates, or did Republican challengers get
more contributions?

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

race_type_by_party <-
  ggplot(data=subset(finance_agg,finance_agg$CAND_PARTY %in% c('REP','DEM')),
         aes(x=CAND_RACE_STATUS)) +
  geom_histogram(stat='count') +
  theme_classic() +
  facet_wrap(~CAND_PARTY,scales='free')

contribution_box_by_party <- 
  ggplot(data=subset(finance_agg,finance_agg$CAND_RACE_STATUS=='C'),
         aes(x=CAND_PARTY,y=TOTAL_CONTRIBUTIONS)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_classic() +
  xlab('Party') +
  ylab('Log of Total Contributions ($)') +
  scale_y_log10()

grid.arrange(race_type_by_party,contribution_box_by_party,nrow=2)

challengers = subset(finance_agg,finance_agg$CAND_RACE_STATUS=='C')
by(challengers$TOTAL_CONTRIBUTIONS,challengers$CAND_PARTY,summary)


```

The plot and summary of total contributions show that challengers had very different
fundraising outcomes depending on party. 

We can see how this trend may have impacted some races by pulling in voteshare 
information for Republican and Democratic challengers. Most of these candidates
are in the House of Representatives, so I'll limit my plot to these.

```{r,echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

challengers = subset(df,df$CAND_RACE_STATUS=='C'&df$CAND_CHAMBER=='H')
incumbents = subset(df,df$CAND_RACE_STATUS=='I'&df$CAND_CHAMBER=='H')
open = subset(df,df$CAND_RACE_STATUS=='I'&df$CAND_CHAMBER=='O')

all_voteshare <- ggplot(data=subset(df,df$CAND_PARTY %in% c('DEM','REP')),
                                aes(x=TOTAL_CONTRIBUTIONS,y=VOTESHARE,
                                    color=CAND_PARTY)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_classic() +
  scale_color_brewer(palette='Dark2',direction=1) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  geom_smooth(method='lm') +
  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0,75)) +
  ylab('Voteshare (%)') +
  xlab('Total Contributions ($)') +
  ggtitle('All Candidates (House)')


incumbents_voteshare <- ggplot(data=subset(incumbents,
                                           incumbents$CAND_PARTY %in% c('DEM','REP')),
                                aes(x=TOTAL_CONTRIBUTIONS,y=VOTESHARE,
                                    color=CAND_PARTY)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_classic() +
  scale_color_brewer(palette='Dark2',direction=1) +
  geom_smooth(method='lm') +
  scale_x_log10() +
  ylab('Voteshare (%)') +
  xlab('Total Contributions ($)') +
  ggtitle('Incumbent Candidates (House)') +
  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(10000,1000000))

challengers_voteshare <- ggplot(data=subset(challengers,challengers$CAND_PARTY %in% c('DEM','REP')),
                                aes(x=TOTAL_CONTRIBUTIONS,y=VOTESHARE,
                                    color=CAND_PARTY)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_classic() +
  scale_color_brewer(palette='Dark2',direction=1) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  geom_smooth(method='lm') +
  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0,75)) +
  ylab('Voteshare (%)') +
  xlab('Total Contributions ($)') +
  ggtitle('Challenger Candidates (House)')

big_plot <- grid.arrange(grid.arrange(all_voteshare,incumbents_voteshare,ncol=2),challengers_voteshare,nrow=2)
```

While this plot shows a strong positive relationship between log of total 
contributions and voteshare, it also shows that Republican challengers 
outperformed Democrat challengers with the same amount of fundraising dollars.

## Final Plots and Summary

#### Candidate Status, Party, and Voteshare
```{r,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
candidate_status
```

This plot shows the initial inference that led me to investigate incumbency.
The distribution of winning and losing voteshares is noticeably different for 
challengers, incumbents, and open races: challengers have a mean voteshare of
about 40% (a losing voteshare in most cases), incumbents have a mean voteshare
of about 60%, and open races are centered at 50%. 

This finding makes sense intuitively: the odds of a candidate who has already won
winning again seem better than an untested one, and it's also likely that name 
recognition or loyalty might cause people to vote for a representative again.

At the same time, I wondered if incumbency might have more tangible benefits that
contribute to this clear divergence in voteshare. Could incumbency actually
impact elections by affecting how well a candidate can fundraise?

#### Contribution size over time
```{r,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
contribution_size_over_time
```

The plot of log contribution amount over time and incumbency suggests that whether 
a candidate is running for re-election or as a challenger has a big impact on their
fundraising. Incumbents receive medium-sized donations for many years compared to
challengers, who start getting donations in the election year. The biggest 
contributions still come in close to the election regardless of incumbency, but
we can imagine that an extra year in which to hire strategists, run polls,
buy ads and billboards, and so on makes a big difference in campaign success.

But how big a difference does it make? And specifically, among candidates
who have the same advantage (incumbents) or disadvantage (challengers), how much
does their fundraising impact their voteshare? For this question, I looked at 
some candidates about whom I have both finance and voteshare data, specifically
for candidates for the House of Representatives. 

These plots show some interesting trend. First, looking at all candidates,
we see a strong trend that more fundraising means more voteshare. We also see
that Republicans always have an edge in voteshare vs. Democrats. 

But looking at just incumbents, we see tightly clustered data in a band around \
$100,000. Neither Republicans nor Democrats have an advantage, and what looks 
like a strong negative relationship seems to be due to outliers. In this limited 
dataset, raising more or less money than the norm doesn't seem to have a big 
impact for incumbents. 

In contrast, we see a gentle linear relationship between fundraising and voteshare
for challengers, as well as a general Republican advantage. Still, those challengers
who broke 50% voteshare were not those with the highest total contributions.


```{r,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
plot(big_plot)
```

All together, these three plots present a highly nuanced relationship between
incumbency, fundraising, and voteshare. We know that incumbency has a big impact
on voteshare. But digging into how incumbency affects fundraising, I see a 
mutlidimensional relationship: wether you're already in office affects how much
you raise and when you raise it. 

But judging by the different trends in the last
plot, it also seems like a dollar may mean more to challengers than incumbents.
An optimistic reading is that an extra TV spot may mean a big bump in votes for
a relatively unknown challenger, while lots of extra spending won't change voters'
perception of a candidate who has already done a poor job in office.

We also see that party has a strong impact on voteshare, and specifically that 
Republicans did better in 2014 than Democrats. This could either suggest a 
general political move to the right--or that the party out of power has an
advantage in midterms. This year, we'll get more data to help answer tha question!

## Reflection

I was surprised and excited by the strength of the relationship between
incumbency and voteshare. This is a political science principal I read in my
Intro to American Politics textbook--but it's exciting to see it plainly in the
data, and fun to look for evidence of *how* incumbency helps candidates.

The main challenge in working with this dataset was the quantity of missing data. 
I was surprised that two datasets from the same source, the FEC, had so little 
overlap, even after pretty extensive cleaning. I also have doubts about the 
accuracy of the data--are there really so many candidates for federal office 
who have raised less than $10,000?

Future work on this data would certainly involve completing this dataset to 
allow for modeling. With a complete dataset, I would like to look at percent
of opponent contributions as a variable. After all, if your opponent has only 
raised \$20,000, it would likely be overkill to raise a million! 
Looking at candidates' fundraising in relation to their opponent would allow me
to normalize contribution data and potentially see clearer trends.
